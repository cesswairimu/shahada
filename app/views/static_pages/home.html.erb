        If you have ever been a student at any time in your life, I bet  you must have had a moment where
        you thought "if only i knew there was no class today" or did i hear the representative  say anything the
        assignment? now am late with it. Definately you must have had one of those days when you are
        totally into learning a subject(we both know how rare it is to get into a mood like that) and in between your 
        studies you find a concept you cannot seem to grasp and you have to understand that concept before you move 
        on to another concept. You try the internet but what you get is a junk of information some talking of 
        a very different thing from the other and you do not know which is which. The time you wish you could 
        have a direct channel to communicate to the lecturer to make things clear for you
        or even ask a question you did not understand before the next class. Or sometimes just ask something
        so a lecturer or a fellow student can answer and maybe get different opinions.<br>
        <i>Shahada is to all those times, the times you thought about how the communication channel for learning
            in the school after classtime is broken.</i>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
        The current communication between the students and the lecturers in
        the department is during lectures
        and also no room for feedback. The other communication through the class
        representative which is he/she is not available is a disaster.
        And also the message from the class
        representative may not reach each and every member of the class in time.

        and the teacher. In doing this the
        classroom gets adequate learning, assignments are
        admitted in time, students can ask questions anytime

        <h3>How? </h3>
        <p> We provide a communication channel between the students and lecturers 
        where a student can ask a question and lecturer or a fellow classmate can answer. 
        The lecturer can also post an assignment in the website and any student in the 
        that year of study can see it. A lecturer can post concerns, food for thought and 
        pretty much anything and the students can comment on the same
